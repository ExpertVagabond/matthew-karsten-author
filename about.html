            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a travel blogger turned author, editor, and publisher. Over the past decade I've visited <strong>70+ countries across six continents</strong>, built a readership of 29,000+ people at Expert Vagabond, and turned everything I learned into books.</p>
            <p>Today I write about the things I care about most: <strong>cryptocurrency security</strong>, <strong>AI-powered development</strong>, and <strong>seeing the world on a budget</strong>. I also help other authors bring their stories to print through my publishing company.</p>
            <p>I believe the best books come from people who've actually done the thing. Every guide I write is tested in the field, not compiled from search results.</p>
